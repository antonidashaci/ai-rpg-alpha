The moon was a dying ember above the Duskwind Marches, its split crescent
flickering behind ribbons of cloud.  Arden Valen—once a soldier, now no more
than a restless wanderer—walked the moss-slick causeway toward Ravenrest.  The
heat of midsummer should have wrapped the night in velvet, yet a breath like
winter sighed across the low reeds.  He paused.  Ahead, half-buried in the
marsh, rose a shard of obsidian taller than a pike and sharper than memory
itself.  The villagers spoke of such stones in hush, naming them Obelisks of
Echoing Stone, but Arden had never seen one this close.  Grey light gathered
along its glassy veins, pulsing to some heartbeat older than any kingdom.

A whisper brushed the inside of his skull—not words, but the idea of teeth on
threadbare cloth.  His hand drifted, unbidden, to the hilt at his side.  Steel,
he reminded himself, was useless against nightmares of time.  Still, the habit
of soldiers is to reach for iron when the world turns strange, and so he let it
rest there, a small comfort against the dark.

"Come no closer."  The voice belonged to a woman cloaked in tattered umber.  She
stood at the water's edge, pale hair tangled with cattails.  Her eyes, one
silver, one black, regarded Arden the way scholars regard a specimen—equal parts
curiosity and caution.

"I only wish passage to the hamlet," Arden said, lifting empty palms.

"Then take the road before dawn stirs."  She tilted her head toward the
obelisk.  "This stone remembers things that mortals forget.  Tonight it chooses
who may listen."

Arden felt the cold deepen.  Fog unrolled across the causeway like a funereal
banner.  Somewhere within that murk, the monolith began to hum.

The sound was music without melody: the creak of a gate older than flesh, the
click of unseen gears, the hush of sand spilling through glass.  Arden's breath
caught.  Images flared—battles reversed in heartbeat, towers un-toppled, rivers
climbing their own banks.  Then came a single lucent vision: a cavern of
mirrors, and within each mirror a creature of tarnished bone devouring threads
of silver light.  Chronovores, the scholars of Miridorn called them—Time Eaters
in the rough tongue.

The woman watched him shiver.  "You felt them," she said, not a question.

"What are they?"

"Appetites with form."  She stepped closer, candle-dim runes flickering across
her gloved fingers.  "I am Lys Veridian of the Chronomancers' Conclave.  The
stone woke tonight and named you witness."

Arden almost laughed.  "I am no seer.  Only a man with coin for ale and scars
for stories."

"The obelisk disagrees."  She pressed a sigil of silver wax to the black glass.
It sputtered, hissed, then sank as though the surface were liquid.  Lines of
violet cracked across the monolith, forming a map Arden could not read.

In their bleak glow he saw Lys clearly: the tremor in her jaw, the fever in her
breath.  Tampering with timeless things cost more than blood—it cost
remembrance, identity, sanity.  Yet she risked it, perhaps for knowledge,
perhaps for the world.

A distant bell tolled from Ravenrest's belfry—three slow notes.  Midnight.
Within the stone, voices answered in a choir of grinding sand.

Sudden light flared at Arden's feet.  A ring of runic fire stitched itself into
the mud, surrounding both wanderer and mage.  From the marsh rose shapes like
silhouettes peeled from gravestones—faceless, hollow, and hungry.  Chronovore
wraiths, echoes rather than flesh.

"Stand your ground," Lys warned, jaw clenched.  "They taste fear."

Arden drew his sword.  The blade felt absurdly mortal against beings of
un-time, yet he planted his stance all the same.  The nearest wraith lunged.  He
swung—a perfect arc his old captain would have praised—but the steel passed
through mist.  Chill seeped into his arm, numbing bone.

Lys raised her hands.  From the rune-circle burst ribbons of pale fire.  They
wrapped the wraiths in lattices of light, stalling them like insects in amber.
But the monolith's cracks widened, birthing more shadows.

"We cannot seal it," she rasped.  "Not tonight."

"Then we run."  Arden seized her wrist.  Together they broke from the circle,
bolting along the causeway toward Ravenrest.  The fog parted only to reveal
more darkness: lanterns snuffed, cottages shuttered, townsfolk sleeping beneath
dreams soon to turn to ash.

At the hamlet gates, church bells clanged—but not in warning.  Their tone was
warped, reversed, as though time itself stumbled backward a single breath.  The
iron notes shivered Arden to the marrow.

Lys spoke over the din.  "The stone has marked you, wanderer.  Your path is no
longer yours alone.  Seek the Hollowveil Kingdom.  The first shard lies beneath
its silver oaks.  Go, before midnight remembers you."

Arden met her mismatched gaze.  In the silver eye he saw dread; in the black,
determination darker than any night.  He nodded once, sheathing his sword.
Ahead, the road wound into shadow, lit only by the hush of restless time.  He
stepped into it, heart drumming a rhythm older than fate, and the bells fell
silent behind him.
