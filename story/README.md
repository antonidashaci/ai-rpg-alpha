# Story Assets

This directory will contain Twine (SugarCube) story files for the dark-fantasy text RPG.

Folders structure proposal:

* `twine/` – original `.twee` or HTML exports.
* `compiled/` – machine-readable JSON (Twison) generated via CI for the engine.
* `scenes/` – Markdown drafts per scene, useful during writing.

> Note: See `PRD_v2_master_prompt.md` for overarching narrative guidelines.
