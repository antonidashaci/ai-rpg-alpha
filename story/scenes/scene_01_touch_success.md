# Scene 01 – Touch Success: Shard of Memory

**Opening Blurb** (English)
> Cold spreads through your veins the instant your fingers brush the stone.  A
> kaleidoscope of lives not your own floods your mind—battles fought beneath
> twin moons, towers rising in reverse, a woman with mismatched eyes sealing a
> breach of silver flame.  When the vision breaks you find a translucent shard
> of dark crystal in your palm, warm like a heartbeat.
