# Scene 03 – Flooded Chapel

**Opening Blurb** (English)
> The chapel squats at the edge of Ravenrest, half-swallowed by marshwater.
> Stained-glass saints stare with sightless eyes through algae-coated panes.
> Inside, the pews float like coffins, and moonlight refracts in ripples across
> a submerged altar where something glints beneath the surface.
