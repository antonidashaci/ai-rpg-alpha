# Scene 01 – Touch Fail: Lingering Dread

**Opening Blurb** (English)
> Agony lances up your arm.  Visions of collapsing stars and devoured cities
> sear your sight.  You tear your hand away, collapsing to your knees.  When the
> pain ebbs you realise minutes—or hours—have vanished.  The monolith stands
> silent once more, but an after-image of fangs lingers behind your eyes.
