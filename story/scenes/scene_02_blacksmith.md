# Scene 02 – Blacksmith Forge

**Opening Blurb** (English)
> Sparks dance like fireflies as the blacksmith's hammer rings against a blade
> glowing sunset-orange.  Ember motes drift toward the rafters where tools of
> war and trade hang like dormant bats.  The smith, Maera Ironhand, pauses and
> studies your weapon with a single raised brow.
