2. **Cosmic Horror Narrative Effects:**
   Risk: Technical complexity of text corruption
   Mitigation: Begin with simple effects, expand gradually

3. **Cross-Scenario Integration:**
   Risk: Save game compatibility issues
   Mitigation: Version-controlled save format, migration tools

4. **Performance with Complex State:**
   Risk: Slow gameplay with deep simulation
   Mitigation: Optimize critical paths, efficient caching
